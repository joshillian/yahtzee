# Yahtzee

** This is my take on a Yahtzee scoring kata as proposed by @samjonester
   here: https://github.com/samjonester/awesome-katas/blob/master/katas/yahtzee.md**
   
   The intent of this project is to serve as an introduction to writing Elixir code.

## Execution
  
```elixir
  mix test
```
